## BYI!!
- take everythin i say/do as platonic!
- PLEASE if i ever do anthing to bother you, tell me!! i hate making people feel bad and id love to know how 2 improve!
- i appreciate cuddles a TON! it brings me a lot of comfort, especially when im stressed. they r very much enjoyed + encouraged!
- im very much a listener rather than a talker, + if you want to talk to me about yr interests im very happy to listen ;)
- if i am covering / behind someone and it doesn't appear to be cuds, it's likely that i have them hidden! please tell me if this happens so i know to move :pp
- i ALWAYS say goodbye before i leave, so if i don't, that means i am having wifi issues or fell asleep!

 i can take small things to heart sometimes so please b mindful of this! im pretty understanding in most cases, but i do appreciate kindness ^_^
